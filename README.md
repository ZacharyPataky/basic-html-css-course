This repository contains the code written during my time studying Jonas Schmedtmann's [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS] course on Udemy.

In order to foster its students into confident and independent developers, capable of building their own websites, this course teaches:

* The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project.  This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!
* How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more.
* How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs.
* How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design).
* How to use the seven steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching.
* How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons.
* Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools.

Feel free to look around if you're interested in reviewing my studies.
